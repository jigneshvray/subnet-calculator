# Subnet Calculator

## Introduction

The Subnet Calculator is a tool designed to help users calculate subnets based on IP address and subnet mask inputs. It simplifies the process of subnetting by providing accurate subnet calculations, allowing users to efficiently manage and configure IP networks.

## Features

- **IP Address Calculation**: Enter an IP address and subnet mask to calculate the corresponding network address, broadcast address, and available host range.
- **Subnet Mask Conversion**: Convert between different subnet mask formats, including CIDR notation, dotted decimal notation, and wildcard mask.
- **Customizable Output**: Choose the output format for subnet details, such as binary, decimal, or hexadecimal representation.
- **Simple Interface**: User-friendly interface with clear instructions and easy-to-use input fields.

## Getting Started

To use the Subnet Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local machine or download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/subnet-calculator/releases) page.
2. **Setup**: No additional setup is required. Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. **Usage**: Enter the IP address and subnet mask in the provided input fields. Click the "Calculate" button to view subnet details.

## Example

Suppose you have an IP address `192.168.1.0` with a subnet mask `255.255.255.0`. After entering these values into the Subnet Calculator and clicking "Calculate," the tool will display the following subnet details:

- Network Address: `192.168.1.0`
- Broadcast Address: `192.168.1.255`
- Available Host Range: `192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254`
